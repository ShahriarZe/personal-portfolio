                            <p>A full-stack developer is a developer or engineer who can build both the front end and the back end of a website. The front end (the parts of a website a user sees and interacts with) and the back end (the behind-the-scenes data storage and processing) require different skill sets. Since full-stack developers are involved with all aspects of the development process, they must have expertise in both.A full-stack developer can work in-house or at a computer development company that engineers websites, software, and other components for other businesses.</p>
